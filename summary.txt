1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

Firstly, I chose Python as the programming language for the coding exercise. 
Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for various applications, 
including web development and developing APIs. Furthermore, it has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, such as FastAPI 
which can help me build REST API more efficiently.

Secondly, I chose FastAPI as the web framework for building REST APIs. After researching, I found that
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework designed for building APIs. It offers several advantages, such as:
- Great performance: FastAPI is built on top of high-performance libraries like Pydantic and Uvicorn
- Automatic documentation: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation, which can help developers understand and 
test the API endpoints more easily
- Easy to use and short

Lastly, Pydantic's BaseModel was used for data validation and parsing, which greatly helped with receiving response request and
validating whether the input was sufficient (POST method)

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

Advantages:
- With the help of FastAPI and python, to make an endpoint, we just need to have "@app.(post/get/put/delete/("link/to/request", status_code=200)".
Comparing with other programming language and libraries, this code implementation for functions for HTTP's methods is much more easier, 
faster and reader-friendly.

- My solution uses "transaction.json" as a place for holding past transactions and balances of each payer as arrays. Thus, it is
easy to add and get the transaction history and the balance in an instant ("/add" and "/balance"), as when transaction came 
through the balance is updated right after automatically.

- With such array, the transactions array can be easily sorted by timestamp and help deducting the user's point spent from payer's balance
efficiently. Furthermore, in transaction array, the "afterpay points" parameter help keep track whether the points in that transactions
are spent already in previous user's point spent. Therefore, it can handle as many times as user's point spent, as long as the amount 
spent does not exceed total points available (else it will return error status code). 

Disadvantages:
- As my solution relies on external libraries like FastAPI, it might introduce potential issues that may took some time to fix
or make it harder to set up and run the code. Furthermore, it is unknown for my solution would perform with increased traffic, which might
slow down the performance a little bit.

- In the spending points part, although "afterpay points" parameter help keep track points after several user's point spent, the main
problem is that it goes through every transaction that have already been deducted already in previous point spent. Therefore, in cases with
a very large number of transactions (over 1000000 for example), the algorithm still have to go through almost all of them. I believe
the more optimal case to have a pointer pointing to the earliest available transaction that can be used for spending points, skipping 
unnecessary parts.
